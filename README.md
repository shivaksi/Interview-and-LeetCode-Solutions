This repo is created ,keeping in mind the coding problems that are usually asked in product based companies. The questions in this repo are from Leetcode (mostly medium and a few hard problems) as well as the questions which I have faced in different interviews (from Companies like Salesforce, Intuit, Walmart, InMobi etc).
The language used here is C++ (for coding problems). In the future, we will also add Design based problems and their solutions in Java or Python
Please feel free to modify and update the repo with more questions and solutions, and also to update any solution, if there is a better and more optimised solution available.
